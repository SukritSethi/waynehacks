        <div class="heading">The Sun</div>
        <div class="desc">
          The Sun is the closest star to Earth and is the center of our solar
          system. It is a massive ball of gas, primarily made up of hydrogen
          (about 74%) and helium (about 24%). The Sun's diameter is
          approximately 109 times larger than Earth, and it is so large that
          more than one million Earths could fit inside it. The Sun generates
          energy through nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms combine to form
          helium, releasing energy in the process. This energy provides warmth
          and light for life on Earth. The Sun's surface temperature is around
          5,500 degrees Celsius, and it has a magnetic field that creates
          sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections.

        <div class="heading">Mercury</div>
        <div class="desc">
          Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is the smallest planet in
          the solar system. It has a cratered surface and no atmosphere, making
          it the hottest planet during the day and coldest planet at night.

        <div class="heading">Venus</div>
        <div class="desc">
          Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, with temperatures
          that can reach up to 864 degrees Fahrenheit. It has a thick atmosphere
          made up mainly of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, creating a runaway
          greenhouse effect.

        <div class="heading">Earth</div>
        <div class="desc">
          Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the only planet known to
          have life. It has a magnetic field that protects us from solar wind
          and a variety of ecosystems that support a wide range of life forms.

        <div class="heading">Mars</div>
        <div class="desc">
          Mars is known as the "Red Planet" due to its iron-rich soil. It has a
          thin atmosphere and polar ice caps made up of carbon dioxide and
          water. It is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus
          Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris.

          Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and has the most
          moons, with at least 79. It has a giant red spot, which is a massive
          storm that has been raging for hundreds of years.

        <div class="desc">
          Saturn is known for its rings, which are made up of ice particles and
          debris. It has at least 82 moons and is the second-largest planet in
          the solar system.

        <div class="heading">Neptune</div>
        <div class="desc">
          Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and is another ice giant.
          It has a dark spot, similar to Jupiter's red spot, and at least 14
          moons. It is also the windiest planet in the solar system, with winds
          that can reach up to 1,200 miles per hour.

          Pluto used to be considered a planet but has since been reclassified
          as a dwarf planet. It has a heart-shaped glacier on its surface and at
          least five moons. It is the largest object in the Kuiper Belt, a
          region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.
